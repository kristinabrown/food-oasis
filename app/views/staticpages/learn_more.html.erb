      A food desert is a geographic area where affordable and nutritious food is difficult to obtain, particularly for those without 
      access to an automobile. Food deserts usually exist in rural areas and low-income communities. Some research links them to diet-related 
      health problems in affected populations.</p>

    <strong>Food Oasis</strong> helps people find and share fruit locally, both backyard bounty and abundance on public lands - 10,000 trees
     nationwide and counting!
     Food Oasis was created to make use of the abundant fruit growing in our urban environments. Currently, 
     the bulk of fruit grown in backyards and in our cities goes to waste, while the fruit we consume is grown in water-intensive 
     orchards far from our homes. We envision a different future, where the bulk of backyard fruit is utilized and shared between neighbors 
     and our diets replete with home-made goodies. Join us in creating a future where the food we eat is truly fresh, seasonal and local!
